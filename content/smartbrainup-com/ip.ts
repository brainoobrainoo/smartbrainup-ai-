      'Prompt Genesi™ is the central logical formula of the AI-UP Second Brain™ method. It represents the only patentable component of the entire system and constitutes the core innovation that enables deterministic AI interaction.',
      'The formula is non-exposed and non-replicable by design. It is never distributed directly to end users or licensees. Instead, it operates as the invisible engine that powers all derivative implementations.',
      'Prompt Genesi™ is anchored on an immutable blockchain ledger, providing timestamped certification, tamper-proof verification, and long-term traceability for intellectual property protection.'

      'PMF™ is a portable implementation that replicates the operational behavior of Prompt Genesi™ without revealing its internal structure. It serves as the standard distribution format for individual and team licensing.',
      'The masked nature of PMF™ ensures that users benefit from the full capabilities of the method while the underlying formula remains protected. This separation between interface and implementation is fundamental to our licensing model.',
      'PMF™ operates across all supported AI platforms — including GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity — maintaining identical behavior regardless of the execution surface.'

      'PMF Dynamic™ is an enterprise-grade variant that incorporates semantic watermarking for source attribution and IP protection. It is designed for organization-wide deployment with full governance and traceability requirements.',
      'The semantic watermarking system introduces subtle logical variations that act as invisible fingerprints, enabling source attribution without affecting operational behavior. This provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized redistribution.',
      'PMF Dynamic™ supports multi-user environments, role-based contexts, and integration with enterprise compliance frameworks.'
