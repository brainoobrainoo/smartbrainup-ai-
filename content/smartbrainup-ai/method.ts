  core: {
    section: "01 — core principle",
    headline: "ai that understands before it answers.",
    paragraph: "most ai systems react to input. this method starts from the situation. before producing answers, it establishes a stable operational context and keeps the interaction anchored to it."
  },

  inversion: {
    section: "02 — interaction model",
    headline: "the flow is reversed.",
    paragraph: "instead of relying on prompts, the interaction is guided through questions. each question narrows the situation. each answer stabilizes the reasoning. clarity is not guessed. it is constructed."
  },

  determinism: {
    section: "03 — determinism",
    headline: "same situation. same logic. stable outcomes.",
    paragraph: "generative ai varies by nature. tone, logic, and direction can shift between interactions. this method constrains the reasoning path, so the interaction remains aligned with the same context every time."

  execution: {
    section: "05 — execution",
    headline: "platform-agnostic.",
    paragraph: "the method is independent from any single ai tool. it can be applied wherever a persistent execution context is supported. you choose the surface. the method remains the same."
  },

  platforms: {
    section: "06 — multiple platforms",
    headline: "one method. multiple platforms.",
    paragraph: "the method is licensed per Second Brain, not per user and not per platform. each Second Brain represents an independent context — a domain, a role, a function. one Second Brain can be executed across multiple ai platforms: gpt · claude · gemini · grok · perplexity"
